# 1. Make sure mandatory libraries are installed: pytest and pytest-cov (both included in requirements.pip)

# 2. Setup the directory structure:
# • create the (empty) file conftest.py at the root of the directory
# • create test/unit/ subdirectory

# 3. Create the first test file test_introduction.py
# • Place it in the respective folder
# • Important: file prefix must be “test_”

# 4. Optionally: create a pytest.ini file, check it for more info
